<p> <strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<body>Calculus,originally called "Infinitesimal Calculus" or "The Calculus of Infinitesimals" is the mathematical study of continous change,in the same way that geometry is the study of shape,and algebra is the study of generalization of arithmetic operations.Calculus,invented from the visions of master minds,took litle time to break through the barrier of theoritical enquiry to practical fields of human activities.<br/>

<b>It has two Major branches<br/></b>

	1.Differential Calculus and <br/>
	2.Integral Calculus<br/>
Infinitesimal Calculus was developed independently in the late 17 Century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.Later work including codifying the idea of limits,put these develpoments on a more solid conceptual foting.Today,calculus has widespread uses in science,engenering and social science.<br/>

<strong><head>How is Calculus used in everyday life</head><br/></strong>

	<mark>Application in Engineering<br/> </mark>An Architect Engineer uses integration in determining the amount of the necessary materials to construct curved shape constructions,determine the exact length of power cable needed to connect two substations.<br/></body>
	<mark><hn>Application in Medical Science</hn> <br/></mark>Biologist use different calculus to determine the exact rate of growth in the bacterial culture when different variables such as temperature and food source are changed.<br/>
	<mark><hn>Application in Physics</hn> <br/></mark>used in calculating Centre of mass,centre of Gravity and Mass movement of Inertia of a sports utility vehicle,velocity and trajectory of an object,predict the position of planets,and understannd electromagnetism.<br/>
	<mark><hn>Applications in Statistics</hn><br/></mark>
	Used to evaluate survey data to help develop business plan for companies.<br/>
	<mark><hn> Applications in Graphicx</hn> <br/></mark>Used to determine how different three-dimensional models will behave when subjected to rapidly changing conditions.It can create realistic environment for movies or video games.<br/>
	<mark><hn>Application in Chemistry</hn><br/></mark> Used to determine the rate of chemical reaction and to determine some necessary information of Radioactive decay reaction. <br/>

	<b><p>List of contributor to calculus</p><br/></b>
	
		<li><strong>Rene Descartes(1596-1650)<br/></strong></li>
		
		
		
		Reflection about early exposure to mathematics. Shows how certain geometrical problems can be solved by algebraic equation,which led to the development of calculus.<br/>
<li><strong>Blaise pascal(1623-1662)<br/></strong></li>
	Pascal's Theorem , 1654:Theory of Probabilities with fermat ,Pascal's Triangle.
	
	
	<li><strong>Isaac Newton(1642-1727)<br/></strong></li>
	
		  1665,he discovered "The Generalised binimial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became infinitesiml calculus.<br/>
	



	<li><strong>Leonhard Euler(1707-1783)<br/></strong></li>
	He Was the first to introduce the concept of a function ,Many of his infinitesimal calculus profs are not accepted now,but his ideas led to many great advances in the field.<br/>
		

<li><strong>Berhard Rieman<br></strong></li>
 Defined the Riemann integral by means of Rieman swens,Develop a theory of Trigonometric series.<br/>
	
 <li><strong>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</strong> </li>
 	Developed the present day notation for the differential and integral calculus.
